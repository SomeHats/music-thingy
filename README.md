MusicThingy
===========

[Demo](http://somehats.github.com/music-thingy)

Music visualization thing with [Popcorn.js](http://popcornjs.org/), CSS 3D transforms, and a load of open data APIs.

The Plan:-
----------
* Choose an band or musician
* Search YouTube for music videos by that band or musician. Choose a video.
* Get some analysis of the track via the [Echonest API](http://the.echonest.com/).
* Get a load of Flickr photos, tweets and stuff relevant to the chosen song / artist.
* Put the photos and tweets and stuff on a sort of Rubik's cube, and 'solve' it in time to the music.
